## What is this project? What does it cover?

A coffee ordering app built in Vanilla JS. This project is a companion project offered in the course [Vanilla JS: You Might not Need a Framework](course) by Maximiliano Furtman on [Frontend Masters](fem). [Here's a link][website] to the course website.

I plan to implement all the functionality covered by the course and the various techniques introduced - DOM manipulation, working with event handlers, building SPA router from scratch, building web components, and finally reactive programming!

# Why?

I decided to Re-Learn web development by exploring the capabilities of building Vanilla JS Apps. The idea is that the more I know about the underlying JavaScript API that actually powers a lot of the existing frameworks today, that I'll have the experience to determine which, if any, is the best tool for any job. After developing React Applications for some time, I think now is a pretty good moment to get reacquainted with the underlying magic that powers it all.
